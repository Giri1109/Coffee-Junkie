    <h1> ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves various types of coffee, notably espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks, such as iced coffee and iced tea, as well as other non-caffeinated beverages. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light snacks, sandwiches, muffins, fruit, or pastries. In continental Europe, some cafés also serve alcoholic beverages. Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations. Some coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise business model, with numerous branches across various countries around the world.

        While café may refer to a coffeehouse, the term "café" generally refers to a diner, British café (colloquially called a "caff"), "greasy spoon" (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport café, teahouse or tea room, or other casual eating and drinking place.[1][2][3][4][5] A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. Many coffeehouses in the Middle East and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world offer shisha (actually called nargile in Levantine Arabic, Greek and Turkish), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah. An espresso bar is a type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks.
        
        From a cultural standpoint, coffeehouses largely serve as centers of social interaction: a coffeehouse provides patrons with a place to congregate, talk, read, write, entertain one another, or pass the time, whether individually or in small groups. Since the popularization of Wi-Fi, coffeehouses with this capability have also become places for patrons to access the Internet on their laptops and tablet computers. A coffeehouse can serve as an informal club for its regular members.[6] As early as the 1950s Beatnik era and the 1960s folk music scene, coffeehouses have hosted singer-songwriter performances, typically in the evening.[7]
        
        Etymology
        
        The word coffee in various European languages[8]
        The most common English spelling café, is the French, Portuguese, and Spanish spelling, and was adopted by English-speaking countries in the late 19th century.[9] The Italian spelling, caffè, is also sometimes used in English.[10] In Southern England, especially around London in the 1950s, the French pronunciation was often facetiously altered to /kæf/ and spelt caff.[11]
        
        The English words coffee and café derive from the Italian word for coffee, caffè[12][13]—first attested as caveé in Venice in 1570[14]—and in turn derived from Arabic qahwa (قهوة). The Arabic term qahwa originally referred to a type of wine, but after the wine ban by Islam, the name was transferred to coffee because of the similar rousing effect it induced.[15] European knowledge of coffee (the plant, its seeds, and the drink made from the seeds) came through European contact with Turkey, likely via Venetian-Ottoman trade relations.
        
        The English word café to describe a restaurant that usually serves coffee and snacks rather than the word coffee that describes the drink, is derived from the French café. The first café in France is believed to have opened in 1660.[12] The first café in Europe is believed to have been opened in Belgrade, Serbia in 1522 as a Kafana (Serbian coffee house).[16]
        
        The translingual word root /kafe/ appears in many European languages with various naturalized spellings, including Portuguese, Spanish, and French (café); German (Kaffee); Polish (kawa); Serbian (кафа / kafa); Ukrainian (кава, 'kava'); and others.
    Every guide for writing a business plan will tell you that the first component to include is the Executive Summary. But since this is a brief synopsis of your entire document, you need to know what's in your business plan before summarizing it. Therefore, although it maintains a prominent place in formal business plans, it is often easiest to write after you have completed all the other sections.

In general, the Executive Summary should briefly explain the concept behind your coffee house business, its proposed location, and projected financials for the company. It should be one to two pages in length and hit all the highlights.

Business Opportunity and Concept
The next step is to describe the business concept and how your business will meet a need within the local market place. Be sure to include in your coffee shop description how your business will fill an untapped niche in the local market. For instance, perhaps your area has a number of national coffee shop chains or small coffee and doughnut shops, but there is no place to comfortably relax and meet friends or colleagues over coffee or a light meal while drinking hand-crafted coffee or other specialty drinks. Explain how your coffee house will not only be a spot to get great coffee, but also be a community gathering place.

In this concept section, your description can be in general terms. Paint a picture of the shop and include a sense of the atmosphere customers will encounter. For example, "The Daily Grind Coffeehouse will feature a comfortable environment to relax, work, and meet friends and business colleagues. Seating for 40 patrons, at both small tables and in several living-room-like settings with chairs and sofas, will encourage guests to stay and socialize."

Include atmosphere inspiring details such as decor featuring work from local artists, live music on the weekends or sponsored book club gatherings.

Niche Market and Differentiation
If you are looking to attract a niche market by offering vegan or gluten free products this will be a key component of your business concept. Again, be sure to describe how your coffee house differs from other stores in your area by offering a unique menu. Distinctions like this extend into how you actually position your business – are you a simple coffee house or are you providing a more extensive cafe environment?</p>
