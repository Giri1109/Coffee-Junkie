      House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and
      every drinker. That is what makes them so unique and so special. The
      blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of the
      roaster and/or distributor. For example, Starbucks describes their House
      Blend as “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. The
      one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters
      work even today. A true reflection of us and delicious cup of coffee,
      period.” Brewing coffee is also an important factor in how the flavors and
      aromas are represented in the cup. Preference depends on the consumer of
      the final cup, but there are clear benefits to different brewing styles.

      Anyone visiting the country of Colombia always ends up with hammocks,
      Mochilas, and a Sombrero Vueltiao hat as a souvenirs. But there’s one
      thing no one ever forgets to bring back home for everyone, and that is,
      Colombian coffee. South America is not only famous for its longest
      mountain range and the largest rainforest, but also for producing the
      best-tasting coffee in the world. So why is this coffee so famous? What
      makes it so special? Does it taste different? Read on to discover why is
      Colombian coffee the world’s favorite.Colombian coffee isn't a coffee
      drink type, like the different types of coffee we know, such as espresso
      and cappuccino. It’s coffee that grows in the farmlands of Colombia, a
      beautiful South American country. This coffee has a rich taste, is
      extremely aromatic, and has a mild flavor with a citrusy hint to it.
      Colombian coffee contains 100% Arabica coffee beans, which is a superior
      coffee bean variety.

      French roast coffee beans offer a distinct charcoal-like flavour that some
      find sweet and smoky. It's much darker than other light roast coffees, so
      the fundamental flavours of each bean are often disguised by the taste of
      its roast instead. As such, regional characteristics within different
      types of coffee beans tend to be hidden due to this strong dark roast
      flavour overpowering them. Contrary to popular belief, light roast coffee
      has a higher caffeine content than French roast. This is due to the fact
      that roasting creates heat which renders some of the molecules in the
      beans inactive or "burned." Therefore, when it comes time for your morning
      cup of joe, don't forget that lighter roasts can give you more of an
      energy boost. French roast coffee beans boast a low caffeine content due
      to their extensive roasting process, making them the perfect selection for
      anyone seeking an espresso with less of a jolt.
